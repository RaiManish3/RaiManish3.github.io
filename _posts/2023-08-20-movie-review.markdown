While there is an extraordinary number of movies that focus on all the good aspects of doing the things
that one loves and not pursuing what provides them guaranteed success, very few actually show that in
reality, these adventures quickly face obstacles from societal norms.
This film explores themes of individualism, the power of literature and poetry, and the conflict between
traditionalism and the pursuit of personal dreams. It encourages the audience to question existing norms
and embrace the importance of self-expression and creativity.

The movie follows the story of a group of students as they navigate the challenges of adolescence and strive
to find their own voices. The school teaches them how to consume material but not how to think, raise important
questions, or be creative. However, this takes a shift when John Keating, an English teacher, arrives on the scene.
He inculcates an idea of Carpe Diem in his students. All it took was this seed idea to make these students go beyond
and try out things for themselves. Little did they know, everything does not happen as per their wish.

The movie captures your attention. It is sufficiently paced for the story to feel natural. Cinematography is thoughtful, 
and some scenes, I'm sure you would have definitely come across even if you haven't seen it. It's brilliant. Over the course
of the movie, you are bound to develop a connection to Keating. That character just gets you. The words he utters directly 
connect with your experiences and your wants. Robin Williams has delivered an outstanding performance as Keating.
He truly made the character memorable. The guy wasn't acting; he literally lived it.
So real that when he delivers a speech, you are bound to be his student.

The ending of the movie is not pleasing to the eyes, as I already mentioned, but that doesn't mean it is sad.
In fact, some (literature folks) might say it is romantic. I do not wish to disclose the reason behind that as it would be a spoiler.
There is a lot one can learn for himself from this movie. I hope you give it a try. [WATCH TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye4KFyWu2do).
