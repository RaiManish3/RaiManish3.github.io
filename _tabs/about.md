Hey there! I'm Manish Rai.

I graduated from IIT Kanpur with Bachelor's degree in CSE.\
I love programming. It allows me to create wonderful stuffs and simplify
some everyday tasks.\
Then, there are mysteries of the cosmos that is of great interest to me.\
I am quite selective on what movies to watch and ever-ready to go on a
trip especially to green parts of the world.\
I also want to do a lot of other things. [Things that excite me](/todo/).

Much happy to collaborate on ideas that are interesting.
